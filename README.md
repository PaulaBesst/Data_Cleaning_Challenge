# Data_Cleaning_Challenge

This is my final result of a data cleaning challenge I participated in.

The jupyter notebook containing the code can be found in this [file](https://github.com/PaulaBesst/Data_Cleaning_Challenge/commit/84313c01d4c4f031e407ae0a3d677e001a5cd371#diff-6f3320cd79d21fdc61e35603e89364dec1c9a7ef91dfda8c780e2b147f10e407)         . The csv file of the clean dataset can also be found here.

The raw data can also be obtained in this file
