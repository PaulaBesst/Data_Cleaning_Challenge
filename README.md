# Data_Cleaning_Challenge

This is my final result of a data cleaning challenge I participated in.

The jupyter notebook containing the code can be found in this [file](https://github.com/PaulaBesst/Data_Cleaning_Challenge/blob/84313c01d4c4f031e407ae0a3d677e001a5cd371/fifa21%20data/FIFA21.ipynb)         . The csv file of the clean dataset can also be found here.

The raw data can also be obtained in this file
